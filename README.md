# Time-Series-Analysis-and-Prediction-on-Electricity-Price
using SAS

## Project Description:
* Overview: Analyzed and predicted American monthly average electricity price by SAS
* Time Series Forecasting for Analytics course project(DNSC 6219), GWU
* Time: May 2018
* Participant: Xuan Yang, Jacky Chen, Jie Min, Guangzhou Xing
* Instructor: Prof. Refik Soyer

## Procedures:
* Built deterministic models including seasonal dummies & trend, exponential smoothing model and ARIMA model to depict characteristics of the series; 
* Compared RMSE as well as mean absolute percent error to select best fitted model; 
* Conducted Multivariate analysis between electricity price and CPI, monthly electricity production and natural gas import by pre-whitening series of predictor;
* used cross-correlation function to estimate transfer model on SAS.
